# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 

  The purpose of this analysis was to provide insight on ride-sharing data for a company based off of the geographic location and region type. Taking the raw data from two separate excel sheets and making it into a single data frame that can be easily read and manipulated for deeper understanding. Along with the information provided from the data frames, plotting and creating a graph to easily show trends over time from a quick glance to any audience. This data will provide a business information to make high quality business decisions and better support those regions that need to find ways to increase revenue or headcount.

Through analyzing the data it shows that although Urban areas receive approximately 68% of the total ride share and account for 63% of total fare revenue for Pyber, due to the high number of areas those drivers receive the least amount per ride. With Urban areas being high density population wise these findings make sense. Rural areas receive about $6 more on average than Urban and $4 more than Suburban. Also, there is a large difference in number of drivers in Rural areas. Focusing on driving up total ride amounts in urban areas since the head count is able to support should be a focus. Along with finding ways to market to new customers in rural areas.

This graph displays how fare amount has fluctuated over a four month span. Feb - March were peak times for all 3 areas with 
a down trend occuring slightly after March and into April for the company. 

## Summary 

In conclusion I would focus on increasing revenues in my top areas and the areas with the greatest capacity to handle more rides. Market to customers in urban areas how inexpensive the ride prices are. Increase marketing efforts in rural areas for both drivers and customers to close the gap, and sell drivers on the higher pay per ride. And finally provide discounts to lower pay wall for rural customers, $55 is 30% higher than the next highest fare price.
